## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

For my project, I considered drawing inspiration from the generative art of **Jon McCormack**. McCormack's work, such as his "Fifty Sisters" series, combines elements of natural growth patterns with algorithmic processes to create complex, plant-like images. This approach aligns well with Anwar Jalal Shemza's 'Apple Tree', as both artworks exhibit a structured yet organic appearance. Employing generative algorithms enables dynamic and evolving interpretations of Shemza's geometric compositions, enhancing the visual complexity and interactivity of the project.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

To dynamically render Anwar Jalal Shemza's "Apple Tree" using natural growth patterns and algorithmic processes, I propose using **Lindenmeyer Systems (L-Systems)**. L-Systems provide a mathematical framework for modeling plant growth processes. They define complex shapes through iterative steps, generating plant-like structures through simple recursive rules. This technique allows for the creation of intricate and detailed models that visually evolve over time, making it ideal for enhancing the complexity and interactivity of project visualizations by simulating natural growth within a geometric framework.

### Example of L-System Implementation
Below is an example of how L-Systems can be programmed and visualized, extending simple rules into detailed forms, effectively bridging the gap between natural growth patterns and geometric artistic expression.
